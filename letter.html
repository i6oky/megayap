        <p>hi sam,</p>
        <p>
          "thanks for everything" is an understatement :) i feel like no matter
          how much i thank you it wont be enough to show how much i appreciate
          you as a friend. tbh joining coding was probably one of the
          <u>best decisions ive made</u>, not just cuz i like it more than
          photog but because i got to know you !!! its insane how if i didnt
          transfer we would have never met, and honestly, my life would be way
          different. i love how you always match my energy and comfort me when
          im kinda upset about something, you just seem to know how to make me
          feel better, so thanks! hahaha its also really fun when we share
          random drama in our cohorts, its always so funny LOL. on a more
          serious note, ik this is kinda weird but
          <u>i rly see you as an older sibling</u>, and honestly even though you
          DONT ALWAYS REPLY MY TEXTS i feel like you actually do care a lot
          about me, so thanks! genuinely youve made my year way brighter, and
          honestly, i think youre really cool and anyone would be really lucky
          to have someone like you as a friend :) from making fun of hailey and
          clara to having randomly deep convos at night, no matter what it is,
          being able to have a conversation with you or just spending time w you
          rly comforts me because idk it just does !!!! and im alw rly happy
          that you offer hugs hehe esp when i got back from OBS i was about to
          die HAHAAHA i really needed that. tbh im kinda embarrassed about it
          and youve probably forgot but i remember this one time i snuck out of
          class to give u and elsa some chocolates and as i was about to leave
          idk why i did this but i gave u a rly awkward hug and ran away idek i
          just felt like you gave rly good hugs LMFAOOO (AND YOU DO)
        </p>

        <p>
          (paragraphing??? who wouldve thought) dude i look up to you a lot, if
          you ever doubt yourself, just remember that. ik you overthink stuff
          but <u>STOP OVERTHINKING IT!!!</u> i rly want you to know that i look
          at you and think "damn i wish i was like her" youre smart you know
          your priorities youre responsible youre funny and i cant think of a
          single reason why anyone would ever not like you hehe dude i dont even
          know when or how i got so comfortable with you but damn its been a
          blessing being able to spend all this time with you. i have a lot of
          insecurities about people secretly hating me and that kind of thing
          but you put so much effort into talking to me, comforting me, and
          laughing w me really makes me feel loved. dude you have no idea how
          much youve changed my life for the better. that time completely
          unprompted you texted me that paragraph the night before my chinese
          oral where i was having a crazy anxiety attack and you told me that
          itll all be okay and "please do not cry" dude you have no idea how
          much that helped me idek it just made me think "shit this person is
          too nice".
        </p>
        <p>
          (wow look a THIRD paragraph!) honestly i also wanna apologise for
          distrurbing you so much ik it can get annoying like bro not this
          <u>YAPPER</u> again HAHAHA but i get this huge sense of relief when
          you reply. i text you so much because idk i text everyone a lot
          <u>IM A YAPPER</u>. and by the way thanks so mcuh for all your notes
          and whatever weird chem acronyms you gave me, they really really
          helped me dude without your help i definitely would NOT have done so
          well for chem bro HAHAHA and dude. i am NEVER gonna forget the time
          you called me at 1am to teach me stupid A MATH TRIGO. i actaully didnt
          know anything and i definitely would not have passed the EOY if you
          didnt teach me !!! fun (irrelevant) fact ðŸ¤“: im so bad at studying
          myself i need smn to explain it down to each and every letter so yeah.
          and im never gonna forget the time we laughed for an hour at claras
          videos "eating social butterflies WHERE YOU AT?" and "get ready with
          me to use my new ipad (because i sat on the previous one ðŸ’€)" funniest
          shit EVER.
        </p>
        <p>
          (THIS IS THE LAST PARAGRAPH I PROMISE!!!!) i dont mean this in a GAY
          way because <u>i am NOT GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</u> but i really think
          about the things you do for me a lot and appreciate every little thing
          you say or do for me. i know this much effort into a stupid little
          website for someone ive only known for less than a year is beyond
          extra but im a stupid nerd and im gonna do stupid nerdy things like
          build websites. honestly i think you deserve way more than this though
          HAHAHEHAEHAHEHA. i hope we dont drift apart but if we really do, im
          gonna really miss laughing at stupid shit with you and just being such
          yappers. i dont know if i can forget the happiness youve brought to my
          life and dude, youre the best, and you deserve the world. i wish for
          you to get whatever you want in your future and all the best ! i love
          you to bits bro seriously. lets get acai, laugh at some stupid shit,
          and talk about anything and everything some time, okay? (and dont
          worry, i promise ill eat all my vegetables)
        </p>
        <p>will miss you always,<br />iso <3</p>
